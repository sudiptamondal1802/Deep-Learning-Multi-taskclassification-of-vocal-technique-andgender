Multitask learning for gender and vocal technique classification from Audio

The identification and knowledge of vocal technique is pivotal for singers to maintain style diversity in their singing; and also crucial for sound production in music and entertainment industry. The analysis of singing voice has been traditionally a challenging task, but with the data availability and  deep learning advancement, this is now achievable.
The aim is to study and compare multi-task classification by deep learning models: CNN and LSTM, for the classification of vocal techniques and gender of audio samples from VocalSet, that comprises of monophonic audio pieces recorded by male and female singers. 

The data preprocessing and model training can be performed with Project in Keras-Multitask learning.py. 

The prediction using the learnt model can be performed using the prediction.py file.

The details related to the comparison of the models and evaluation is explained further in the attached pdf file.
